Revision history for Complete-Getopt-Long

0.14    2014-09-04 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

        - Make dependency to 'Complete::Getopt::Long' optional to shorten the
          prerequisite list.


0.13    2014-08-06 (SHARYANTO)

        - Provide 'words' and 'cword' to completion routine.


0.12    2014-07-29 (SHARYANTO)

        - [ux] When only completing option names, give proper option name
          escaping.


0.11    2014-07-28 (SHARYANTO)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Support completion of bundled short options.

        - Provide 'nth' argument for completion routine, so it can know that an
          option has been given n times (e.g. in '--foo 1 --foo ^' the first foo
          has nth=0, the second nth=1).


0.10    2014-07-27 (SHARYANTO)

        - Some fixes.

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - To avoid cascading parent_args within parent_args (and so on), replace
          it with 'extras'. Now you can chuck all the extra stuffs you want
          to pass to completion routine here.


0.09    2014-07-27 (SHARYANTO)

        - Support the deprecated 'completion' argument as hash. Undocumented and
          will be removed in the future though.


0.08    2014-07-27 (SHARYANTO)

        - [ux] Proper escaping mode when completing environment variables.


0.07    2014-07-27 (SHARYANTO)

        - [ux] Completion routine can now return undef so that
          complete_cli_arg() calls default/fallback completion routine that
          complets from environment vars ('$foo'), usernames ('~foo'), or files.


0.06    2014-07-27 (SHARYANTO)

        - Completion routine now gets extra information/arguments. In addition
          to 'word', it now also gets: type, opt, ospec, argpos, parent_args,
          seen_opts.

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - 'completion' argument is now a single coderef instead of hash of
          coderefs/arrays. I think this is conceptually simpler and does not
          force the user to specify for every opt spec if she doesn't need to.


0.05    2014-07-26 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add option: fallback_completion.

        - Provide default fallback_completion that can complete environment
          variables ($foo), Unix usernames (~foo), wildcards (foo*), or
          filenames.

        - Other fixes.


0.04    2014-07-26 (SHARYANTO)

        - Change algorithm so things become simpler.

        - Now does not repeat mentioned non-repeatable option names (including
          aliases and abbreviated), e.g. when you have getopt_spec =>
          {'help|h'=>sub{}, 'hour=i'=>sub{}, 'foo=s'=>\@ary}, then if cmdline is
          (^ marks the point of completion) '--he --h^' or '-h --h^' then it
          will complete to ['--hour'] only because '--help' has been mentioned.
          But repeatable option can be repeated, e.g. '--foo --^' will complete
          to ['--foo', '--help', '--hour'].


0.03    2014-07-24 (SHARYANTO)

        - Handle equal sign (--foo=<tab>).


0.02    2014-07-22 (SHARYANTO)

        - [Bugfix] Fix endless loop after flag option.


0.01    2014-07-22 (SHARYANTO)

        - First release.
